## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Masterâ€™s in Computer Science | UMass Amherst (2023-2025)
### Machine Learning | Computer Vision | NLP (LLMs) | Research Enthusiast | Seeking Full-time Roles (2025)

I am a Masterâ€™s student at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), specializing in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP, with a passion for applying these technologies to solve real-world problems. My coursework includes Advanced NLP, Reinforcement Learning, and Secure Distributed Systems, alongside various research-driven projects.

In Summer 2024, I interned at [UMassâ€™s Center for Data Science](https://ds.cs.umass.edu/), collaborating with [Doctors Without Borders](https://donate.doctorswithoutborders.org/secure/give-monthly-double-your-impact-search-onetime-reverse?ms=ADD2301U3U49&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=BRAND.DWB_CKMSF-BRAND.DWB-GS-GS-ALL-DWBBrand.E-BO-ALL-RSA-RSARefresh.2-MONTHLY&gclid=CjwKCAjwxY-3BhAuEiwAu7Y6s7lRMYymJHI3pSoGET3GSSqOeW1vXfL5xc17FhKQw9-aKidOz3bIuRoCVVwQAvD_BwE) to automate data entry using OCR. Before that, I worked as a Scientist at [ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in/) (2021-23), focusing on anomaly detection, automated data acquisition systems, and data analysis for satellite testing.

I have multiple publications, including an **IEEE** paper on "Faster Training of Edge-attention Aided 6D Pose Estimation Model" and research on image denoising. My research has also been presented at the Space Propulsion Conference, 2022.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in ECE from IIST, Trivandrum, and I'm actively seeking full-time opportunities in 2025 to leverage my expertise in AI, ML, and NLP for impactful innovation.
